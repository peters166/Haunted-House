            It's October 31st and Dracula's Mansion has risen after a century of slumber!!! 
            <br/>
            ...in the middle of Utica, New York. It has received some renovations throughout the years, no longer appearing as the castle as it once was.
            <br/>
            Don't worry, you have brought a <b>suspicious conch shell that you brought for twenty dollars</b>. 
            <br/>
            You can play it to <b>return back to the outside of the mansion</b>.
        </p>
        <p id = "visittext">
            Dracula is actually quite kind to any guests that come in. However, that doesn't matter.
            <br/>
            You hate him! So you woke up extra early to be the first one there to get to the mansion!
            <br/>
            Your objective is to find your way to his room and kill him. However, you have entered in completely unarmed.
            You need to find a way to also arm yourself before you actually arrive.
