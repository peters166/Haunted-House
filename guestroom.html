            You're inside the guest room.

            A whole lot of nothing inside. Nobody else has entered the mansion yet, as the invitation calls for the time to be evening.
        </p>
        <p id = "visittext">
            You see a display with a bottle that reads: "Antique Holy Water, preserved 1476"
            <br/>
            You really do question why Dracula would preserve a bottle of holy water this long.
            <br/>
            Wouldn't hurt to grab it. Vampires hate holy water.
