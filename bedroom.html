            Dracula sleeps peacefully.
            <br/>
            It's a bit hard to believe he's a vampire when he looks almost human enough to be identical to the typical posh person.
            <br/>
            The time is right, so you approach for an ambush.

            Suddenly, Dracula's eyes flash open and is alerted of your presence.
            <br/>
            "What in the- How did you get here?"
            <br/>
            He opens a nearby drawer and surprisingly pulls out a gun. "It'd take a miracle if I ever see you again!"
            <br/>
            While it definitely seems like Dracula, the fact he is standing in full sunlight with the curtains open triggers your fight or flight response.
